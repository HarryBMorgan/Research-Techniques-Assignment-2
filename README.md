# Research-Techniques-Assignment-2
The second assignment from my Research Techniques in Astronomy University course.

There was 3 programmes to write for this assignment. They are described below.
1) Task 1 was to write a Python function that calculates the first order Bessel function, then compares it to SciPy's version of the function. Then I was required to generate a light diffraction pattern that resembles that of light being focused through a telescope.
2) I wrote a Python code that creates "Random" data from a probability distribution function. This was done using the Transformation Method. (The use of this is to create data that resembles a PDF but looks like observed data.)
3) The data from task_2 was used and assumed to be obsevational data. Then a power law distribution was assumed to be the best approximation to it's behaviour. Using this knowladge, the method of maximum likelihood was used to calculate the most likely form of the power law PDF. This was itterated through a loop many times to generate a god approximation for the power law PDF.

The report that was written to accompany it explains this all in more detail.
